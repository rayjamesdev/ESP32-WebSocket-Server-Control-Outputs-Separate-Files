ESP32 WebSocket Server: Control Outputs Separated the HTML, JS, CSS files

Hi there, I took the code from the tutorial located at: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-websocket-server-arduino/ which had all the code in the main Arduino file.  I separated the code into separate HTML/JS/CSS files.  Had to add/change a few lines of code but for the most part I didn't change any of the functionality.

In order to get SPIFFS working, which is how you upload the files to the ESP32 please follow this tutorial: https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin or Follow the SPIFFS install portion of this video(timestamp from 1:54 to 2:42): https://youtu.be/mkXsmCgvy0k?t=114

Good Luck Have Fun!
